# custom-page-mass-action

Open Source Community: This is an example of how to call a mass action from a custom page.

While this is an open source project on the kCura GitHub account, support is only available through the Relativity developer community. You are welcome to use the code and solution as you see fit within the confines of the license it is released under. However, if you are looking for support or modifications to the solution, we suggest reaching out to one of our development partners.

Please note: This is a proof of concept solution and not intended for use in a production environment. Additionally, this project uses methods outside of the Relativity API to implement the functionality and could potentially break the release of Relativity after the version it was created for.
